# StudEx Group — Workspace Index

**40 assets** across **7 business lines** · updated 2026-09-25 · v1.0.0

| Stage | Count | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `live` | 11 | Shipped and reachable today. |
| `ready` | 22 | Complete and cleared to send or deploy; not yet fired. |
| `draft` | 5 | Substantially built, needs a pass before it leaves the building. |
| `research` | 2 | Intelligence and source material. Feeds other assets; not a deliverable itself. |

## Business lines

- [[Coffee]] — Rwanda origin into China and South African enterprise. _(10)_
- [[Meat — Wagyu Biltong]] — Wagyu biltong and the subscription box around it. _(6)_
- [[StudBot Super Agents]] — The agentic operating system. This is the product the rest of the group runs on. _(6)_
- [[Operations]] — War rooms and dashboards. Where the machine is watched. _(4)_
- [[Agent OS]] — What any agent reads on the way in. Treat as the constitution. _(6)_
- [[Capital & Pitch]] — What goes in front of investors and partners. _(3)_
- [[Content & Brand]] — The media library behind every campaign. _(5)_

## Finished but not fired

22 assets are complete and cleared, and not yet live. This is the
group's real backlog — work already paid for, earning nothing.

## How this vault works

```
vault/            ← you edit here. This is the source of truth.
  Assets/         one note per asset. Frontmatter is data, body is yours.
  Lines/          one per business line. Body above the marker is yours.
  Meta/Register   the register's own settings.
      ↓  npm run sync
assets.json       generated. Never edit by hand.
      ↓
WORKSPACE-INDEX.md · index.html · studex-platform /workspace route
```

Add an asset by creating a note in `Assets/` with the same frontmatter keys as
its neighbours, then run `npm run sync`. A bad stage, an unknown line or a
duplicate id will stop the sync and name the file, rather than quietly dropping
the asset out of the register.
