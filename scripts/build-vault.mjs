/**
 * assets.json  ->  the generated regions of the vault
 *
 * Asset notes are yours; this never touches them. What it writes is:
 *   vault/Lines/<Line>.md   the region below the BEGIN GENERATED marker
 *   vault/00 Index.md       the whole note — a dashboard, entirely derived
 *
 * Each generated table ships twice: a Dataview block for live querying inside
 * Obsidian, and a static Markdown table in a collapsed callout so the vault
 * still reads correctly in Logseq, Foam, plain VS Code or on GitHub, where
 * Dataview does not run.

## How this vault works

\`\`\`
vault/            ← you edit here. This is the source of truth.
  Assets/         one note per asset. Frontmatter is data, body is yours.
  Lines/          one per business line. Body above the marker is yours.
  Meta/Register   the register's own settings.
      ↓  npm run sync
assets.json       generated. Never edit by hand.
      ↓
WORKSPACE-INDEX.md · index.html · studex-platform /workspace route
\`\`\`

Add an asset by creating a note in \`Assets/\` with the same frontmatter keys as
its neighbours, then run \`npm run sync\`. A bad stage, an unknown line or a
duplicate id will stop the sync and name the file, rather than quietly dropping
the asset out of the register.

const previous = existsSync(indexFile) ? readFileSync(indexFile, "utf8") : "";
